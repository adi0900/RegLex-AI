  "summary": "This document outlines a comprehensive Personal Power Loan Agreement between Axis Bank Ltd. and Poyyar Dass S, originating from the Asset Sales Centre (ASC) Madurai. The agreement details a sanctioned loan amount of Rs. 20,00,000 with a fixed interest rate of 10.49% per annum over a tenure of 84 months, resulting in an Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) of Rs. 33,711. The applicant, Poyyar Dass S, has provided communication and permanent addresses in Tirunelveli, India, and is employed by WSP CONSULTANTS INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED.\n\nThe agreement includes an acknowledgement form where the borrower confirms understanding and agreement with the provided information, including a non-refundable processing fee of Rs. 8,259. It specifies various charges such as cheque bounce charges (rate prevailing on date of default + taxes), and detailed foreclosure/part payment charges. Foreclosure charges are 3% + GST for up to 36 EMIs and 2% + GST thereafter, with an important exemption: no foreclosure charges apply after 12 EMIs for loans of Rs. 10 lakhs or more if foreclosed from the customer's own funds, though part payment charges remain applicable for such loan sizes. Interest on the loan accrues from the date of disbursal, with the first EMI calculated based on the actual number of days remaining until its due date.\n\nKey legal provisions cover the bank's rights, including the ability to revise repayment terms, amend conditions, disclose borrower information to various entities (including credit rating agencies and RBI), and appropriate employer dues in case of employment cessation. Borrower obligations include providing accurate information, ensuring the loan's purpose is fulfilled, prompt repayment, and notifying the bank of any changes in address or employment. The document also clearly defines events of default, such as failure to make timely payments or breach of agreement terms, which can lead to the immediate recall of the loan. Furthermore, it details the classification of accounts into Special Mention Accounts (SMA) and Non-Performing Assets (NPA) based on overdue periods, in accordance with RBI guidelines, and includes an arbitration clause for dispute resolution, with specific jurisdictions for high-value disputes.\n\nAdditional clauses cover miscellaneous aspects like the bank's right to call for additional security, the appropriation order of payments, and the governing law and jurisdiction. The agreement also includes a Demand Promissory Note for Rs. 20,00,000 and a Post-Dated Cheques Covering Letter, reinforcing the borrower's commitment to repayment and acknowledging the bank's right to use these instruments.",
