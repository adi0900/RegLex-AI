  "summary": "This document outlines a Personal Power Loan Agreement between Axis Bank Ltd. and Poyyar Dass S., located at ASC Madurai. The loan, identified by application form No. MLP000107070594, is for a sanctioned amount of Rs. 20,00,000 at a fixed interest rate of 10.49% per annum, repayable over 84 months with Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) of Rs. 33,711. Key financial details include a non-refundable processing fee of Rs. 8,259 and various charges such as cheque bounce charges, penal charges (rate prevailing on date of default + taxes), and foreclosure/part payment charges. Foreclosure charges are 3% + GST up to 36 EMIs and 2% + GST thereafter, calculated on the principal outstanding. Notably, no foreclosure charges apply after 12 EMIs for loans of Rs. 10 lakhs or more if foreclosed from the customer's own funds, though part payment charges still apply for such loan sizes. The borrower acknowledges understanding these terms and confirms no cash payments were made in connection with the application. The agreement also specifies that the bank is not obligated to provide advance notice of changes in charges and reserves the right to modify terms or recall the facility in case of default. The borrower is required to inform the bank one month in advance of any changes in communication address, job, or profession. Interest on the loan accrues from the date of disbursal, with the first EMI calculated based on the actual number of days remaining until its due date, while subsequent EMIs are based on a 30-day period. Disbursement is typically via Banker's Payment Order or Demand Draft, and the bank may cancel any undrawn portion of the loan without notice.

The agreement further details the definitions of terms like \"Agreement,\" \"Bank,\" \"Borrower,\" \"EMI,\" and \"Personal Power Loan.\" It establishes the bank's right to lend and the borrower's obligation to repay, commencing from the agreement date until all dues are cleared. Conditions for loan disbursement include the submission of an employment certificate, financial statements, post-dated cheques/ECS/Standing Instruction mandates, and other required documents or approvals. The borrower is responsible for ensuring prompt monthly EMI payments and maintaining adequately funded bank accounts for auto-debit. Failure to do so incurs penal charges and constitutes a default, making all outstanding sums immediately due. The bank retains broad rights, including revising repayment terms, amending agreement conditions, adjusting insurance payments, disclosing borrower information to third parties (including credit rating agencies), and requiring employers to remit dues upon the borrower's cessation of employment.

The document outlines various events of default, such as failure to pay any amount due, default on other loans, breach of agreement terms, resignation/removal from employment, provision of incorrect information, insolvency, or depreciation of security value. Upon default, the bank can declare all outstanding sums immediately due and enforce security. The bank also has a lien and right of set-off on all moneys belonging to the borrower in any account. The bank has the right to sell or transfer the loan, but the borrower cannot assign their rights. An arbitration clause mandates that any disputes arising from the contract be resolved through arbitration by a single independent institution, with the seat of arbitration in Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, or Mumbai, and proceedings conducted in English. For high-value disputes exceeding Rs. 20,00,000, if arbitration is not invoked or is unenforceable, competent courts in these cities will have jurisdiction. Finally, the agreement incorporates RBI guidelines (dated 12-11-2021) on the classification of Special Mention Accounts (SMA) and Non-Performing Assets (NPA), defining terms like 'Dues,' 'Overdue,' and the 'First In First Out' (FIFO) principle for payment appropriation, along with illustrative examples of account classification based on the age of oldest dues."
